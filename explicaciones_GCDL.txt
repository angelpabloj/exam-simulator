34: Before taking the Cloud Leader exam, you must review this page. Expect several questions on the adoption framework.
The framework assesses four themes:
 	- Learn: the quality and scale of your learning programs.
  	- Lead: the extent to which your IT departments are supported by a mandate from leadership to migrate to Google Cloud.
 	- Scale: the extent to which you use cloud-native services and how much operational automation you currently have in place.
 	- Secure: the capability to protect your current environment from unauthorized and inappropriate access.
cloud.google.com/architecture/migration-to-gcp-getting- started#gcp_adoption_framework
---
35: Learn and Lead are "topics" not themes.
We must review this page before the exam. We can expect several questions directly from this page.
cloud.google.com/architecture/migration-to-gcp-getting- started#gcp_adoption_framework
Themes are:
- Tactical: There are no coherent plans covering all the individual workloads you have in place. You're mostly interested in a quick return on investments and little disruption to your IT organization.
- Strategic: There is a plan to develop individual workloads with an eye to future scaling needs. You're interested in the mid-term goal to streamline operations to be more efficient than they are today.
- Transformational: Cloud operations work smoothly, and you use data gathered from those operations to improve your IT business. You're interested in the long-term goal of making the IT department one of the engines of innovation in your organization.
---
36: Optimize shows full cloud-native capacity.
cloud.google.com/architecture/migration-to-gcp-getting- started#gcp_adoption_framework
There are four phases of your migration:
- Assess: In this phase, you perform a thorough assessment and discovery of your existing environment to understand your app and environment inventory, identify app dependencies and requirements, perform a total cost of ownership calculations, and establish app performance benchmarks.
- Plan: In this phase, you create the basic cloud infrastructure for your workloads to live in and plan how you will move apps. This planning includes identity management, organization and project structure, networking, sorting your apps, and developing a prioritized migration strategy.
- Deploy: In this phase, you design, implement, and execute a deployment process to move workloads to Google Cloud. You might also have to refine your cloud infrastructure to deal with new needs.
- Optimize: In this phase, you begin to take full advantage of cloud-native technologies and capabilities to expand your business's potential to things like performance, scalability, disaster recovery, costs, training, and opening the doors to machine learning and artificial intelligence integrations for your app.

40: Compute Engine VM comes with a single root persistent disk hosted on Persistent Disk.
Persistent disks are durable network storage devices that your instances can access, like physical disks on a desktop or server. The data on each persistent disk is distributed across several physical disks. Compute Engine manages the physical disks and the data distribution to ensure redundancy and optimal performance.
Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine (VM) instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks or add more to an instance to meet your performance and storage space requirements.
Image is loaded onto root disk during boot process. cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks

50: The five essential characteristics are:
- On-demand self-service
A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
- Broad network access
Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use on any device.
- Resource pooling
The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.
- Rapid elasticity
Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. 
- Measured service
Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service. Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

53: Folders are nodes in the Cloud Platform Resource Hierarchy. A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. Organizations can use folders to group projects under the organization node in a hierarchy. For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of Google Cloud resources. Folders allow you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders are used to group resources that share common IAM policies. While a folder can contain multiple folders or resources, a given folder or resource can have exactly one parent.
